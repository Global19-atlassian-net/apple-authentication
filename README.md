If you're looking for Apple Sign In for React Native, check out the [expo-apple-authentication](https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/master/packages/expo-apple-authentication). This works in both vanilla React Native and managed Expo projects ([as do other Expo SDK APIs](https://blog.expo.io/you-can-now-use-expo-apis-in-any-react-native-app-7c3a93041331)).
